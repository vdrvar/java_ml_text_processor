# Java Translation Application

## Project Overview
This Java-based application leverages the Apache OpenNLP library to create a basic translation system. Designed for educational purposes, the project demonstrates the integration of natural language processing (NLP) techniques within a Java environment to process and 'translate' text. The application utilizes a Spring Boot backend for API management and JavaFX for the graphical user interface, providing a simple yet interactive platform for users to input text and view processed outputs.

## Key Features
- **Text Processing**: Uses Apache OpenNLP to handle basic NLP tasks, simulating a translation process.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built with JavaFX, the interface allows real-time text input, submission, and display of the processed text.
- **API Integration**: A RESTful API created with Spring Boot connects the frontend and the backend, facilitating efficient data exchange.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for backend and GUI development.
- **Apache OpenNLP**: Open-source machine learning toolkit for natural language processing.
- **JavaFX**: Toolkit for developing and delivering desktop applications and rich Internet applications with a lightweight user interface API.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications easily.

## Installation and Usage
Instructions for setting up, compiling, and running the application are provided in the repository, ensuring users can easily get the system up and running on their own machines.
