# Java ML Text Processor

This project demonstrates text processing capabilities using Apache OpenNLP and JavaFX, featuring a simple interactive GUI for educational purposes. The application performs tokenization, sentence detection, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, showcasing basic NLP techniques with machine learning models.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: Splits text into individual tokens (words).
- **Sentence Detection**: Identifies and separates sentences within the text.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Tags each token with its corresponding part of speech.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Detects and labels named entities (such as people, organizations, etc.).
- **Export Results**: Allows users to export processed text or results to a local file.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- JavaFX SDK 22.0.1
- Apache OpenNLP library
