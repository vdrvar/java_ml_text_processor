# java_ml_text_processor

This project demonstrates text processing capabilities using Apache OpenNLP and JavaFX, featuring a simple interactive GUI for educational purposes. The application performs tokenization, sentence detection, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition, showcasing basic NLP techniques with machine learning models.

## Features
- **Tokenization:** Splits text into individual tokens (words).
- **Sentence Detection:** Identifies and separates sentences within the text.
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging:** Tags each token with its corresponding part of speech.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Detects and labels named entities (such as people, organizations, etc.).
- **Export Results:** Allows users to export processed text or results to a local file.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or higher
- JavaFX SDK
- Apache OpenNLP library

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/java_ml_text_processor.git
